1
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,493
Hi

2
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:18,578
Hi

3
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,039
How was your day?

4
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,250
The pipes burst at
Manokhin's building site

5
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:50,568
''Mother, mother, what will we do.
Mother, mother, how will we live. ''

6
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,163
How's our A-student?

7
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:04,457
He's out with friends

8
00:03:04,457 --> 00:03:06,543
Vovka!

9
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,628
I forgot to buy bread,
could you nip out...

10
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:14,175
and buy some noodles?

11
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:33,945
Comrade, that man says
he's an alien, we have
to do something

12
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,030
Call the police

13
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,410
I will, but he's barefoot,
he'll catch a cold

14
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:44,956
Hello!

15
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:48,501
<font color=#9DFF82>Hello.
I smell bad, I'm sorry</font>

16
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,755
<font color=#9DFF82>It's cold. I got this
from that metal box</font>

17
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:52,714
Well done

18
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,007
<font color=#9DFF82>Friend!</font>

19
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,926
<font color=#9DFF82>Please tell me your
planet number in tentura,</font>

20
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:59,512
<font color=#9DFF82>or at least the galaxy
number in the spiral</font>

21
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:04,058
<font color=#9DFF82>I've got the contacts
mixed up and now
I can't get home</font>

22
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:08,271
We don't know the
number mate, we forgot it

23
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,356
Look, let's send this lad
to the information office,

24
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:14,444
and we'll wait for him
together in the bakery, OK?

25
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,529
Here,
put this on

26
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,241
<font color=#9DFF82>Thank you.
Listen, friends,</font>

27
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:22,327
<font color=#9DFF82>there's no need for
an information office...</font>

28
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,412
<font color=#9DFF82>or bakery</font>

29
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,498
<font color=#9DFF82>This is my planet,</font>

30
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:29,334
<font color=#9DFF82>Uzm, 247
in tentura,</font>

31
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:32,253
<font color=#9DFF82>galaxy Beta
in the spiral</font>

32
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:36,466
<font color=#9DFF82>This is my space-
transportion gadget</font>

33
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:40,345
<font color=#9DFF82>So, which button
do I press to get home?</font>

34
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:43,598
<font color=#9DFF82>Because time is relative,
you understand that, right?</font>

35
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,683
OK, I have
a proposition

36
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:48,770
We will press a button...

37
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,855
and transport
to your place

38
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,941
But if the device
doesn't work...

39
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:58,154
you will transport with us
to where we tell you, deal?

40
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:01,741
<font color=#9DFF82>You can't just press it,
you have to know!</font>

41
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,952
Yes we can...

42
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,473
What do you see?

43
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:26,474
Sand

44
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,478
So the fucking gizmo worked

45
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:37,152
And that jerk with the holes,
was he left behind?

46
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,823
Calm down, calm down

47
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:49,497
We have sun,
sand and gravity

48
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:52,834
We are on Earth or...

49
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,835
Or?

50
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:58,506
No,
we'll assume we're on Earth,
in some desert

51
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,592
Say, Karakum

52
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:04,179
What other deserts
do we have?

53
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,513
Gobi, Sahara...

54
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:06,848
I said we have!

55
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,933
Kyzylkum

56
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:15,857
No. We'll assume
it's Karakum

57
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:24,199
So, sun is to the West,
Ashabad is there

58
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,284
Let's go

59
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:35,210
Come on!

60
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:05,573
Comrade,
what's your name?

61
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,243
Vladimir Nickolaevich

62
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,912
My name is Gedevan

63
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,997
Pleased to meet you

64
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,935
You have a bottle in your case
Is it wine?

65
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:38,606
No, vinegar

66
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:43,945
I also have some herbs

67
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:47,282
We're all set then

68
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:57,292
Vladimir Nickolaevich,
do you remember the
number he mentioned

69
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,377
the guy who has my sock?

70
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,463
No

71
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:05,300
Maybe we're on his planet?

72
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,385
Listen, Fiddler...

73
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:11,306
we can guess all we want
but it's bloody pointless

74
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:14,642
We've chosen a direction
and that's where we're heading

75
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:19,314
We just need to get to the water.
Clear?

76
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:26,654
Vladimir Nickolaevich,
I want to change into slippers

77
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:27,989
Well do it!

78
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:31,326
Well stop then!

79
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,668
What time is it?

80
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:42,003
Four

81
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,089
In the morning?

82
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,174
Yes

83
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,348
Are you late
somewhere?

84
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,017
It's embarrassing

85
00:08:56,017 --> 00:09:00,688
I called from the
airport, said I'd be
there in an hour, and...

86
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,774
You study music?

87
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,859
It's not mine

88
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:11,699
We had a concert
in my hometown,

89
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,369
and they forgot to put
the violin on the plane

90
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,037
Banquet?

91
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:17,372
Just a dinner

92
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:21,376
Oh.
Are you from Tbilisi?

93
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,377
Batumi

94
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:27,048
I thought I'd return
the violin and still catch
the train to my college

95
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:30,051
I study textile
manufacturing

96
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:31,386
Aha

97
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:37,392
I wanted to study
Foreign Politics,
but they said...

98
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,477
Quiet!

99
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:41,372
A man

100
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:48,546
Hello

101
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,940
It's a capitalist country

102
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,338
Do you speak any
foreign languages?

103
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:33,800
English, a little French

104
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,885
Tell them we
have no money

105
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:40,640
Tell them!
They want to be paid!

106
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,792
Hello!

107
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:11,254
We are our tourists,
we lost our group

108
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:13,757
Please give us a ride
to the nearest city,

109
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:15,842
and we'll find our
way from there

110
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:16,843
Translate

111
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:26,519
Hello

112
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,374
<font color=#9DFF82>Chatl!</font>

113
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,795
We have no money

114
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:55,882
<font color=#00FF40>We left money, passports
and foreign currency
with our guide</font>

115
00:12:55,882 --> 00:13:02,430
<font color=#00FF40>We stepped aside
for a moment and got
lost in the sands</font>

116
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,906
<font color=#00FF40>Here. It's warm</font>

117
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:23,952
<font color=#00FF40>Pardon?</font>

118
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,623
<font color=#00FF40>You want my hat?</font>

119
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,708
<font color=#00FF40>Here you go</font>

120
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:42,679
<font color=#00FF40>It's not mine,
I can't give it away</font>

121
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,853
<font color=#00FF40>There's nothing in there</font>

122
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:51,438
<font color=#00FF40>Open it</font>

123
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,863
<font color=#00FF40>It's not wine,
it's vinegar</font>

124
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,667
<font color=#00FF40>Sour, right?</font>

125
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,640
<font color=#00FF40>So mate, will you
give us a lift?</font>

126
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,726
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler, hurry up</font>

127
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:39,194
<font color=#00FF40>Just to the nearest city,
we'll be all right there</font>

128
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:44,157
<font color=#00FF40>You want my jacket?</font>

129
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,012
<font color=#00FF40>Glad I didn't give
them the violin</font>

130
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,411
<font color=#00FF40>Looks like they're sorry</font>

131
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:49,597
<font color=#FF8040>Ketse!</font>

132
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,643
<font color=#00FF40>Ketse what?</font>

133
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,150
<font color=#00FF40>I think he
wants a match</font>

134
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,235
<font color=#00FF40>You want a match?</font>

135
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:09,909
<font color=#00FF40>Here</font>

136
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,802
<font color=#00FF40>The whole box?</font>

137
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:34,309
<font color=#00FF40>Get us out of here,
and we will koo</font>

138
00:17:53,304 --> 00:18:00,937
<font color=#00FF40>Not a single letter,
not a single 'made in'</font>

139
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:10,864
<font color=#00FF40>Sorry,
I don't understand.</font>

140
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,757
<font color=#00FF40>What do they want?</font>

141
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:31,676
<font color=#00FF40>They want koo</font>

142
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,903
<font color=#00FF40>Tsak!</font>

143
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:52,489
<font color=#00FF40>Thank you</font>

144
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,915
<font color=#00FF40>He wants me
to put on a bell</font>

145
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,835
<font color=#00FF40>He'll have
to do without</font>

146
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:13,635
<font color=#00FF40>I'll put it on.
It's too awkward</font>

147
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,847
<font color=#00FF40>Go ahead</font>

148
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:49,712
<font color=#00FF40>Oh, all right</font>

149
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:30,897
<font color=#00FF40>I'll just have a cigarette</font>

150
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,484
<font color=#00FF40>Ketse!</font>

151
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,569
<font color=#00FF40>Calm down, calm down!</font>

152
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:32,834
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
maybe we're really on...</font>

153
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:37,255
<font color=#00FF40>Yeah right, they're
typical Martians</font>

154
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:07,410
<font color=#00FF40>Lucy dear, you silly bitch.
You just hadto have those
noodles didn't you?</font>

155
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:24,010
<font color=#00FF40>So. You speak Russian
Why did you hide it?</font>

156
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:26,096
<font color=#00FF40>We didn't</font>

157
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:32,060
<font color=#00FF40>It's hard to penetrate
your language when your
thoughts are bilingual</font>

158
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,481
<font color=#FF8040>And this Patsak always
thinks in languages
he hardly knows!</font>

159
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:40,068
<font color=#FF8040>What are you looking at,
mimuna verishvilli?</font>

160
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,821
<font color=#00FF40>They speak Georgian, too!</font>

161
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,655
<font color=#00FF40>What did he say?</font>

162
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,157
<font color=#00FF40>Ape son of a donkey</font>

163
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:48,243
<font color=#00FF40>All right!</font>

164
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:51,704
<font color=#00FF40>We are from the Soviet Union,
here on a cultural exchange</font>

165
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:53,790
<font color=#00FF40>Everybody knows
where we are</font>

166
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,502
<font color=#00FF40>If you don't put us in
touch with the embassy...</font>

167
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,089
<font color=#00FF40>you'll be in big trouble,
got it?</font>

168
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:09,681
<font color=#FF8040>We don't understand embassy
Put the tsak back!</font>

169
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:14,936
<font color=#00FF40>You understand 'Noodles'
and you understand 'mimuna',</font>

170
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:19,065
<font color=#00FF40>yet you don't know 'embassy'?
You poor things</font>

171
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,860
<font color=#00FF40>Quit messing with us!</font>

172
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,823
<font color=#00FF40>You thought about noodles,
I simply said it</font>

173
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:30,410
<font color=#00FF40>It's not Earth,
and it's not Africa mate</font>

174
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:39,544
<font color=#00FF40>It's planet Pluk, 215 in tentura,
in the galaxy Kin-Dza-Dza in the spiral</font>

175
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,212
<font color=#00FF40>Got it?</font>

176
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:47,010
<font color=#00FF40>Well hello, here we are</font>

177
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,265
<font color=#00FF40>Put the bell on mate</font>

178
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:03,068
<font color=#00FF40>Well done</font>

179
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,058
<font color=#00FF40>Excuse me,
where are we?</font>

180
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:38,228
<font color=#FF8040>Hush! He has
very sharp ears</font>

181
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:40,313
<font color=#FF8040>Do you know the tentura
of your planet?</font>

182
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:41,981
<font color=#00FF40>Tentura?</font>

183
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:45,735
<font color=#00FF40>Well, tell us your
Galaxy number in the spiral</font>

184
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:47,946
<font color=#00FF40>In the spiral?
Yes, in the spiral, in the spiral</font>

185
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:55,787
<font color=#00FF40>Well, Earth is... next to
planets like Venus,
Saturn, Jupiter...</font>

186
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,623
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
what else?</font>

187
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,500
<font color=#00FF40>Ursa Major</font>

188
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,585
<font color=#FF8040>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
come here</font>

189
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,429
<font color=#FF8040>Do you have more matches
on your planet?</font>

190
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:13,680
<font color=#00FF40>I can get some</font>

191
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,100
<font color=#FF8040>How many will you give us
if we put you there?</font>

192
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,185
<font color=#00FF40>How many do you want?</font>

193
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:22,439
<font color=#00FF40>Two boxes like that!</font>

194
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:24,023
<font color=#00FF40>Seven!</font>

195
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:30,613
<font color=#FF8040>And give me this box now,
I'll buy a gravitsapa</font>

196
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:32,699
<font color=#00FF40>Excuse me,
what is a gravitsapa?</font>

197
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:37,829
<font color=#00FF40>Without it pepelats
can only fly like this...</font>

198
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:44,127
<font color=#00FF40>but with it - to any place
in the universe in 5 seconds</font>

199
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:50,383
<font color=#00FF40>Gentlemen, you don't even
take a pepelats out of the
garage without a gravitsapa?</font>

200
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:54,137
<font color=#FF8040>We had a gravitsapa,
but when we came here,
it got pinched</font>

201
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:56,347
<font color=#00FF40>Excuse me, do you have a
space-transporting gadget?</font>

202
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:57,849
<font color=#FF8040>No</font>

203
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:59,809
<font color=#FF8040>Give me the matches</font>

204
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:01,895
<font color=#00FF40>Give us some water</font>

205
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,589
<font color=#FF8040>Like this!
Like this!</font>

206
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:35,261
<font color=#00FF40>This is yours;
this is how you smoke now</font>

207
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:36,179
<font color=#00FF40>Thank you</font>

208
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:43,728
<font color=#FF8040>He said he has
a gravitsapa</font>

209
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,856
<font color=#FF8040>Put your matches here</font>

210
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,903
<font color=#00FF40>No.
When you put us on Earth,
you'll get this and this</font>

211
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:52,821
<font color=#FF8040>What?</font>

212
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,949
<font color=#00FF40>Let's go, Fiddler,
to Outer Space</font>

213
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,995
<font color=#FF8040>Stop!
Give it!</font>

214
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:06,626
<font color=#00FF40>Only on mother Earth</font>

215
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,590
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
you said if we get you to the
city, you'd give us all of it!</font>

216
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,676
<font color=#00FF40>And you already stole
one match from us!</font>

217
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:18,263
<font color=#00FF40>Patsaks do not
cheat on Patsaks,
it's wrong, mate</font>

218
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,348
<font color=#00FF40>I said - to the city!</font>

219
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:21,683
<font color=#FF8040>And what is this?</font>

220
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:22,642
<font color=#00FF40>A barn</font>

221
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:31,109
<font color=#FF8040>And this?
And this?
How is it's not a city?</font>

222
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,194
<font color=#00FF40>Stop messing around</font>

223
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:39,576
<font color=#00FF40>Let's see that gravitsapa.
If it's a major brand
- we'll take it</font>

224
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:41,661
<font color=#FF8040>Patsak!</font>

225
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:47,417
<font color=#FF8040>No one will touch
smuggled ketse
in front of witnesses,</font>

226
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,253
<font color=#FF8040>you can get etsih for life
with nails for it!</font>

227
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:52,338
<font color=#FF8040>What do you have in your head,
brains or kyoo?</font>

228
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:58,094
<font color=#00FF40>We'll buy it ourselves.
Let's go</font>

229
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:03,141
<font color=#FF8040>Stop!</font>

230
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,023
<font color=#FF8040>Who are you?</font>

231
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,864
<font color=#00FF40>Alien,
construction site foreman</font>

232
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:19,949
<font color=#FF8040>No,
you are Patsak</font>

233
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:20,992
<font color=#FF8040>And who are you?</font>

234
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,285
<font color=#00FF40>I'm Georgian</font>

235
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:25,413
<font color=#FF8040>No,
you're also Patsak</font>

236
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:28,541
<font color=#FF8040>You, you and him
are Patsaks</font>

237
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:32,003
<font color=#FF8040>And I'm Chatlan,
and they are Chatlans,</font>

238
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:36,091
<font color=#FF8040>so put on the tsak
and stay in the pepelats,
got it?</font>

239
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,342
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

240
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,136
<font color=#00FF40>Look at me through
the scanner, mate</font>

241
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:45,183
<font color=#00FF40>See,
it's a green colour</font>

242
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:51,147
<font color=#00FF40>Same for him and you</font>

243
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:56,486
<font color=#00FF40>Now look at Uef,
orange colour</font>

244
00:29:56,486 --> 00:30:01,491
<font color=#00FF40>That's because
he is Chatlan.
All clear?</font>

245
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:02,117
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

246
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:04,202
<font color=#00FF40>Pluk is a Chatlan planet</font>

247
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,455
<font color=#00FF40>So, we Patsaks,
have to wear tsaks</font>

248
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:13,086
<font color=#FF8040>And in front of us Chatlans,
you have to do this!</font>

249
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,173
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
this is overtly racist</font>

250
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:19,259
<font color=#00FF40>Show us again please</font>

251
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,344
<font color=#FF8040>Like this!</font>

252
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:22,846
<font color=#00FF40>Slower, please</font>

253
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:24,931
<font color=#FF8040>Like this</font>

254
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:32,230
<font color=#00FF40>Look, you have a wife,
a son struggling
for a C average,</font>

255
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,025
<font color=#00FF40>and you are behind
on your mortgage</font>

256
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:41,990
<font color=#00FF40>You don't want to
mess with us, mate</font>

257
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:50,915
<font color=#00FF40>OK, Fiddler,
we'll play their game</font>

258
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:56,087
<font color=#00FF40>Well done.
Give a match to Uef,
he'll buy a gravitsapa</font>

259
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,173
<font color=#00FF40>He said he needed
them all</font>

260
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,258
<font color=#FF8040>I was joking</font>

261
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,343
<font color=#00FF40>Gentlemen,
you are so funny!</font>

262
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:08,683
<font color=#FF8040>Wait!
We'll go together</font>

263
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:16,733
<font color=#FF8040>Don't show them
any of your ketse,
and don't think about them,</font>

264
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,818
<font color=#FF8040>just show them mine</font>

265
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:21,571
<font color=#FF8040>And don't give them
more than half a match</font>

266
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,035
<font color=#00FF40>Your Patsak said
it costs a whole match</font>

267
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,954
<font color=#FF8040>He was joking too</font>

268
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,265
<font color=#00FF40>Concrete mark 300</font>

269
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,689
<font color=#FF8040>Patsak! Remember,
half or less</font>

270
00:31:56,689 --> 00:31:57,982
<font color=#00FF40>OK</font>

271
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,860
<font color=#00FF40>Excuse me,
are Chatlans and Patsaks
different races?</font>

272
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,946
<font color=#FF8040>No</font>

273
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:04,739
<font color=#00FF40>Biologically different?</font>

274
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:05,698
<font color=#FF8040>No</font>

275
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:07,784
<font color=#00FF40>People from
different planets?</font>

276
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:08,618
<font color=#FF8040>No</font>

277
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:11,204
<font color=#00FF40>So how are
they different?</font>

278
00:32:11,204 --> 00:32:17,335
<font color=#FF8040>Are you colour-blind, Fiddler?
Can't you tell green from orange?
Tourist!</font>

279
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,222
<font color=#00FF40>Hey!
It's a skyscraper!</font>

280
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:33,435
<font color=#FF8040>Go, go</font>

281
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,241
<font color=#FF8040>Do as I taught you</font>

282
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:54,372
<font color=#00FF40>Hi missy.
Aren't you cold
in this coat?</font>

283
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:08,553
<font color=#FF8040>They won't let me in,
they want you alone</font>

284
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:13,058
<font color=#FF8040>Don't give them the ketse,
bring the gravitsapa here,
I'll check it</font>

285
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,311
<font color=#00FF40>Go!</font>

286
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:21,441
<font color=#FF8040>No</font>

287
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:23,526
<font color=#00FF40>We're together</font>

288
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:25,612
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
tell him!</font>

289
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:30,492
<font color=#00FF40>Wait here</font>

290
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:41,127
<font color=#00FF40>Don't go anywhere</font>

291
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:02,065
<font color=#00FF40>Hi!</font>

292
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,862
<font color=#00FF40>What's up?</font>

293
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,034
<font color=#00FF40>You want me
to squat?</font>

294
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:19,165
<font color=#00FF40>Well, out of respect
for the ladies</font>

295
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:23,002
<font color=#00FF40>So what's
new on Pluk?</font>

296
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:28,508
<font color=#FF8040>Put ketse here and
you'll get a gravitsapa</font>

297
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,396
<font color=#00FF40>A half</font>

298
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,607
<font color=#FF8040>Half it is</font>

299
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,153
<font color=#00FF40>Can I take a look?</font>

300
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,238
<font color=#FF8040>Sure</font>

301
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,754
<font color=#00FF40>I'm not an expert</font>

302
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:10,383
<font color=#00FF40>We'll show it to my
Chatlan, he'll check it</font>

303
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:14,596
<font color=#FF8040>Just a moment while
we install the tsapa</font>

304
00:35:31,988 --> 00:35:33,948
<font color=#00FF40>Sore throat?</font>

305
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:40,705
<font color=#FF8040>It's water</font>

306
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,791
<font color=#00FF40>I have a proposition</font>

307
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:49,714
<font color=#00FF40>I'll give you the rest
of this ketse for
two bottles of water</font>

308
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:51,674
<font color=#FF8040>Ok</font>

309
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:05,021
<font color=#00FF40>Do you have food?</font>

310
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,107
<font color=#FF8040>Cereals</font>

311
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:09,192
<font color=#00FF40>What kind?</font>

312
00:36:10,693 --> 00:36:13,029
<font color=#FF8040>Plastic</font>

313
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:31,089
<font color=#00FF40>I'll give you this whole ketse
for five bottles of water
and a kilo of cereals</font>

314
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:35,427
<font color=#FF8040>What's this?</font>

315
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,512
<font color=#00FF40>Ketse</font>

316
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,140
<font color=#FF8040>We have to
check it again</font>

317
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,474
<font color=#00FF40>Check</font>

318
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,205
<font color=#00FF40>Hey,
just a moment!</font>

319
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:06,291
<font color=#FF8040>Be right back</font>

320
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:39,616
<font color=#FF8040>Fiddler, can you get
matches on Earth?</font>

321
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:42,952
<font color=#00FF40>Yes</font>

322
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:52,295
<font color=#FF8040>If you can spit
further than me,
I'll give you half a chatl</font>

323
00:37:54,005 --> 00:38:00,345
<font color=#FF8040>If I can spit further,
you'll give me
two matches</font>

324
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,354
<font color=#FF8040>Understood?</font>

325
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,021
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

326
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:17,070
<font color=#FF8040>It's a simple game.
I bet half a chatl,
you bet 3 matches. Spit</font>

327
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:19,155
<font color=#00FF40>No, thank you</font>

328
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:25,745
<font color=#FF8040>OK, you bet one match,
I bet three chatls,
yellow pants</font>

329
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:29,082
<font color=#FF8040>and I'll give you
a head-start like this.
Come on!</font>

330
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,749
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

331
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:31,835
<font color=#FF8040>Blue pants!</font>

332
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:33,920
<font color=#00FF40>Mr Uef,
under no circumstances
will I do this</font>

333
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:36,005
<font color=#FF8040>Is this your
final word?</font>

334
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:44,139
<font color=#FF8040>Then why are you
messing with me,
mimuna verishvilli!</font>

335
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:53,148
<font color=#00FF40>Mr Uef! I represent a
civilised planet and demand
you to watch your lexicon!</font>

336
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:55,233
<font color=#00FF40>Yeah!</font>

337
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:23,887
<font color=#00FF40>Where are they?</font>

338
00:39:24,554 --> 00:39:25,972
<font color=#FF8040>Who?</font>

339
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:28,058
<font color=#00FF40>That one,
with a scar</font>

340
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,143
<font color=#00FF40>I'm such a moron,
I gave him all the matches</font>

341
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:45,802
<font color=#00FF40>Gentlemen,
that's enough</font>

342
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:49,139
<font color=#00FF40>Enough?
Enough?</font>

343
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:52,809
<font color=#00FF40>I told him we should
go to the Centre</font>

344
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:59,733
<font color=#00FF40>But he's greedy like
all Chatlans, he decided
to save 2 chatls!</font>

345
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:02,152
<font color=#00FF40>I have another one</font>

346
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:09,534
<font color=#00FF40>Enough to buy
a gravitsapa, right?</font>

347
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:12,746
<font color=#00FF40>Give it to me</font>

348
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:13,705
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

349
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,790
<font color=#00FF40>To buy a gravitsapa</font>

350
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,002
<font color=#00FF40>Where?</font>

351
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:21,087
<font color=#00FF40>There,
in the Centre</font>

352
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:25,884
<font color=#00FF40>How will you get
us to Mother Earth</font>

353
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:30,555
<font color=#00FF40>if you don't even know
which galaxy it's in?</font>

354
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,432
<font color=#FF8040>You moron, we can get
your planet number</font>

355
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:36,144
<font color=#FF8040>from any planetarium
in the Centre for 2 chatls!</font>

356
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,606
<font color=#00FF40>Give me the match</font>

357
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,691
<font color=#00FF40>So you can bury
us in the sand?</font>

358
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:43,777
<font color=#00FF40>Will you give it to me?</font>

359
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:44,277
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

360
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,362
<font color=#00FF40>Is this you final word?</font>

361
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:49,574
<font color=#00FF40>Couldn't be more final</font>

362
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:57,707
<font color=#00FF40>Farewell then, mate</font>

363
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,132
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
they'll fly off</font>

364
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:09,886
<font color=#80FF00>No way, they'd
rather die than
leave the match</font>

365
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,731
<font color=#FF8040>Either you give us
the match now,</font>

366
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:27,362
<font color=#FF8040>or we won't put
you on Earth for
less than 7 boxes!</font>

367
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:55,348
<font color=#00FF40>Yes you can, mate</font>

368
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,642
<font color=#00FF40>Mr. Bee,</font>

369
00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:03,857
<font color=#00FF40>I have 50 roubles</font>

370
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,277
<font color=#00FF40>Matches cost
2 kopeks per box,</font>

371
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,030
<font color=#00FF40>so I can buy 2500</font>

372
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:14,784
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler's fibbing!
He has more chatls</font>

373
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:25,712
<font color=#00FF40>Mr Uef! Don't call me Fiddler,
my name is Gedevan Alexandrovich</font>

374
00:43:34,763 --> 00:43:36,306
<font color=#00FF40>Is the engine there?</font>

375
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,311
<font color=#FF8000>Quit poking around,
Gedevan Alexandrovich</font>

376
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:50,361
<font color=#00FF40>Gedevan, let's
tie them up and plot a
course to the North</font>

377
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:52,864
<font color=#00FF40>What for?</font>

378
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,284
<font color=#00FF40>Maybe the
Mediterranean Sea is there</font>

379
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:00,997
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich,
are you nuts, mate?</font>

380
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:03,083
<font color=#00FF40>Pluk has no seas</font>

381
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:07,212
<font color=#00FF40>They have been made
into luts long ago</font>

382
00:44:07,837 --> 00:44:10,673
<font color=#00FF40>Excuse me,
into what?</font>

383
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,386
<font color=#FF8000>Into fuel, Fiddler</font>

384
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:19,391
<font color=#FF8000>You owe us
6140 boxes</font>

385
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:21,267
<font color=#00FF40>Why so much?</font>

386
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:25,647
<font color=#FF8000>You ate cereals,
you drink water,
plus the widget</font>

387
00:44:27,524 --> 00:44:30,610
<font color=#00FF40>Cross that out, we are
not buying the widget.
Put it back</font>

388
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:46,251
<font color=#00FF40>We need to bring back
a sample of technology,
or no-one will beleive us</font>

389
00:44:46,543 --> 00:44:50,588
<font color=#00FF40>If you want the
widget so much,
give them the violin</font>

390
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:57,470
<font color=#00FF40>It's an Italian
antique worth more
than 1000 roubles,</font>

391
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,265
<font color=#00FF40>how would I ever
pay it back?</font>

392
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:09,023
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler, instead of thinking
that you are the first
Georgian astronaut</font>

393
00:45:09,023 --> 00:45:12,444
<font color=#FF8000>and that you'd
get a Nobel prize,</font>

394
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:16,823
<font color=#FF8000>give back the
spoon you stole
from us poor artists</font>

395
00:45:18,992 --> 00:45:21,828
<font color=#00FF40>I wasn't thinking
any of that</font>

396
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:32,422
<font color=#00FF40>I wanted to donate it to science,
maybe it's some new metal</font>

397
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:40,847
<font color=#00FF40>There's never been a Patsak
as pathetic as you, Fiddler</font>

398
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:44,267
<font color=#00FF40>I'm devastated</font>

399
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:50,857
<font color=#FF8000>Where are you going?</font>

400
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:52,400
<font color=#00FF40>To the toilet</font>

401
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:54,486
<font color=#FF8000>You can't take
money to the toilet</font>

402
00:45:54,486 --> 00:46:00,200
<font color=#FF8000>Leave money here,
Gedevan Alexandrovich</font>

403
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:39,531
<font color=#00FF40>Ketse is very
expensive, mate</font>

404
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:40,782
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

405
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:44,911
<font color=#00FF40>Well how, on Earth
do you determine</font>

406
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:46,996
<font color=#00FF40>how many times who
has to squat in
front of whom?</font>

407
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:49,999
<font color=#00FF40>We just play it by the ear</font>

408
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:52,877
<font color=#FF8000>Barbarians!</font>

409
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:54,963
<font color=#FF8000>Look,</font>

410
00:46:55,755 --> 00:46:58,633
<font color=#FF8000>I like you,
so I'll teach you</font>

411
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:02,095
<font color=#FF8000>If I have
some ketse,</font>

412
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:04,973
<font color=#FF8000>I have a right to
wear yellow pants</font>

413
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:10,729
<font color=#FF8000>Also Patsaks have to
squat in front of me
not once, but twice</font>

414
00:47:11,354 --> 00:47:14,524
<font color=#FF8000>If I have a
lot of ketse</font>

415
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:19,946
<font color=#FF8000>I have the right to
wear purple pants</font>

416
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,034
<font color=#FF8000>and Patsaks have to
squat in front of me twice!</font>

417
00:47:25,034 --> 00:47:28,872
<font color=#FF8000>and Chatlans
have to koo</font>

418
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:35,879
<font color=#FF8000>and etselops can't
beat me up at night,
never!</font>

419
00:47:36,504 --> 00:47:39,340
<font color=#00FF40>I have a
proposition, mate</font>

420
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:42,552
<font color=#00FF40>You give us
the match now</font>

421
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:46,681
<font color=#00FF40>and later we will bring
you yellow pants, deal?</font>

422
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,851
<font color=#00FF40>Thanks, I already have a pair,
maybe Fiddler needs some?</font>

423
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:55,899
<font color=#00FF40>Hey Fiddler, aliens are
peddling yellow pants here,</font>

424
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:57,817
<font color=#00FF40>do you need any?</font>

425
00:47:59,736 --> 00:48:01,321
<font color=#00FF40>There is no Fiddler, mate</font>

426
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:01,946
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

427
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,573
<font color=#FF8000>I've catapulted him</font>

428
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:05,658
<font color=#00FF40>It's all right,
Vladimir Nickolaevich,</font>

429
00:48:05,658 --> 00:48:07,744
<font color=#00FF40>we have another catapult</font>

430
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:09,829
<font color=#00FF40>That one was
broken anyway</font>

431
00:48:10,246 --> 00:48:11,915
<font color=#00FF40>I don't get it</font>

432
00:48:11,915 --> 00:48:15,960
<font color=#FF8000>I've pressed the
kappa and he flew away</font>

433
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:20,757
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler isn't needed, mate,
he was a waste of fuel</font>

434
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:33,812
<font color=#00FF40>Turn back</font>

435
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:35,897
<font color=#00FF40>We can't</font>

436
00:48:36,356 --> 00:48:38,900
<font color=#FF8000>We're out of luts,
we have to fly to
the luts station</font>

437
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:43,363
<font color=#00FF40>Turn back or
I'll burn this fucking ketse!</font>

438
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:48,743
<font color=#00FF40>Gedevan!</font>

439
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,458
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler!</font>

440
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:16,146
<font color=#00FF40>Where could
he have gone?</font>

441
00:49:16,146 --> 00:49:19,649
<font color=#FF8000>I told you,
the etselops caught him</font>

442
00:49:20,608 --> 00:49:21,860
<font color=#00FF40>Let's go, mate</font>

443
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:23,945
<font color=#00FF40>You've really
done it now!</font>

444
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,785
<font color=#00FF40>Call the etselops
on the radio</font>

445
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,289
<font color=#FF8000>We have no radio,
we threw it away</font>

446
00:49:34,622 --> 00:49:36,499
<font color=#00FF40>I'll check!</font>

447
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:37,459
<font color=#FF8000>Etselop!</font>

448
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,221
<font color=#00FF40>Put the tsak on, now!</font>

449
00:49:53,683 --> 00:49:55,935
<font color=#00FF40>He'll have to
do without</font>

450
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:12,786
<font color=#00FF40>Put it on or he'll
trangluke you...
and the match</font>

451
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,052
<font color=#00FF40>Hello</font>

452
00:51:11,678 --> 00:51:13,930
<font color=#00FF40>Listen, friend,
we lost our lad
around here,</font>

453
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,515
<font color=#00FF40>did you see him?</font>

454
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:19,352
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

455
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:34,826
<font color=#00FF40>Sorry, I forgot</font>

456
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,579
<font color=#00FF40>So did you
pick him up?</font>

457
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:22,749
<font color=#FF8000>I told you Fiddler
wasn't needed!</font>

458
00:52:23,124 --> 00:52:27,587
<font color=#FF8000>How will we
buy luts now?</font>

459
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:34,844
<font color=#00FF40>You are such
a silly bitch, mate</font>

460
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:37,931
<font color=#FF8000>He's worse.
He's just a kyoo</font>

461
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:16,594
<font color=#00FF40>I have
a proposition</font>

462
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:18,680
<font color=#00FF40>We find Fiddler,</font>

463
00:53:18,972 --> 00:53:20,724
<font color=#00FF40>and then we'll go
to the local government</font>

464
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:22,809
<font color=#00FF40>Get me some
sand, mate</font>

465
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:28,314
<font color=#00FF40>We'll tell them
where we are from</font>

466
00:53:30,734 --> 00:53:34,863
<font color=#00FF40>they'll give us a
gravitsapa and we will</font>

467
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:39,325
<font color=#00FF40>organise a mutually
beneficial trade...</font>

468
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:46,583
<font color=#00FF40>you'll give us yellow pants
and we'll give you as many
matches as you want</font>

469
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:49,669
<font color=#00FF40>We need a gravitsapa
to go to the government</font>

470
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:54,174
<font color=#00FF40>The government lives on
another planet, mate</font>

471
00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:43,848
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova!
I'm here!</font>

472
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:04,202
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler!</font>

473
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:07,622
<font color=#00FF40>Where is my...
what's it called?</font>

474
00:55:07,622 --> 00:55:08,665
<font color=#00FF40>Tsak?</font>

475
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:14,546
<font color=#00FF40>I have it</font>

476
00:55:14,546 --> 00:55:15,588
<font color=#00FF40>Give it to me</font>

477
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:16,589
<font color=#00FF40>What for?</font>

478
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:18,675
<font color=#00FF40>Just give it to me!</font>

479
00:55:22,804 --> 00:55:24,180
<font color=#00FF40>But there is
nobody here</font>

480
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:26,975
<font color=#00FF40>This is mine</font>

481
00:55:27,308 --> 00:55:29,060
<font color=#00FF40>So keep it at the ready</font>

482
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:52,125
<font color=#00FF40>Are you asleep?</font>

483
00:55:53,877 --> 00:55:54,878
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

484
00:55:55,253 --> 00:55:56,963
<font color=#00FF40>Cheer up, Fiddler</font>

485
00:55:57,672 --> 00:56:01,468
<font color=#00FF40>If there is a gravitsapa
on Pluk, we'll find it</font>

486
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:04,220
<font color=#00FF40>We've had it
much worse</font>

487
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:11,102
<font color=#00FF40>Quiet</font>

488
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:16,274
<font color=#00FF40>Stop!</font>

489
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:21,112
<font color=#00FF40>Hey, would you give
us a lift to the Centre?</font>

490
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:22,155
<font color=#00FF40>Patsak, stop</font>

491
00:56:22,155 --> 00:56:23,531
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

492
00:56:24,908 --> 00:56:27,327
<font color=#00FF40>That's close enough</font>

493
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:29,412
<font color=#00FF40>What do you want?</font>

494
00:56:29,412 --> 00:56:31,498
<font color=#00FF40>Give us a lift!</font>

495
00:56:31,498 --> 00:56:33,583
<font color=#00FF40>3 chatls</font>

496
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:37,670
<font color=#00FF40>We have no money,
but we'll work for it</font>

497
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,756
<font color=#00FF40>What can you do?</font>

498
00:56:40,423 --> 00:56:42,509
<font color=#00FF40>Me? Anything!</font>

499
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:43,510
<font color=#00FF40>Be specific</font>

500
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,680
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich
works in construction</font>

501
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,433
<font color=#00FF40>we'll build
you a house</font>

502
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:52,519
<font color=#00FF40>And what
can you do?</font>

503
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:54,604
<font color=#00FF40>Me?</font>

504
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:58,691
<font color=#00FF40>He can play violin</font>

505
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:00,318
<font color=#00FF40>Play!</font>

506
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:05,240
<font color=#00FF40>I can't</font>

507
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,325
<font color=#00FF40>Bye Patsaks</font>

508
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:12,997
<font color=#00FF40>Wait, missy,
I can</font>

509
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,666
<font color=#00FF40>Play!</font>

510
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,334
<font color=#00FF40>Here?</font>

511
00:57:16,334 --> 00:57:18,420
<font color=#00FF40>Over there!</font>

512
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:44,112
<font color=#00FF40>Wait, I'll sort
out the sound</font>

513
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:50,785
<font color=#00FF40>Play</font>

514
00:57:54,664 --> 00:57:55,790
<font color=#00FF40>And sing</font>

515
00:58:00,253 --> 00:58:02,464
<font color=#00FF40>Right,
just a sec</font>

516
00:58:03,006 --> 00:58:05,258
<font color=#00FF40>How does it go...</font>

517
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:11,347
<font color=#00FF40>Mother, mother,
what will we do?</font>

518
00:58:11,347 --> 00:58:13,433
<font color=#00FF40>Wow!</font>

519
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:15,226
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

520
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:15,810
<font color=#00FF40>I said wow</font>

521
00:58:16,352 --> 00:58:18,021
<font color=#00FF40>People like it</font>

522
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:19,147
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

523
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:21,232
<font color=#00FF40>People like it!</font>

524
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:40,794
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

525
00:58:42,462 --> 00:58:43,588
<font color=#00FF40>I could drum</font>

526
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:44,672
<font color=#00FF40>How's that?</font>

527
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:49,677
<font color=#00FF40>Foreman!</font>

528
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:51,888
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler isn't needed</font>

529
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:56,893
<font color=#00FF40>It's OK, he
won't be a bother</font>

530
00:58:56,893 --> 00:58:58,978
<font color=#00FF40>Give us some
water, will you?</font>

531
00:58:59,145 --> 00:59:01,356
<font color=#00FF40>I said
- after the gig</font>

532
00:59:01,898 --> 00:59:10,782
<font color=#00FF40>We could just
take it, by force</font>

533
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:14,661
<font color=#00FF40>You touch me and an
etselop will fly right here
and tear your legs off</font>

534
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:16,746
<font color=#00FF40>Screw your etselop!</font>

535
00:59:17,455 --> 00:59:20,250
<font color=#00FF40>Calm down, Fiddler,
don't get the lady
all worked up</font>

536
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,671
<font color=#00FF40>Hey, Foreman!</font>

537
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:37,475
<font color=#00FF40>Look</font>

538
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:47,444
<font color=#00FF40>Yeah, I got it</font>

539
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:54,117
<font color=#00FF40>Look, do you have
a friend with a gravitsapa
and a pepelats?</font>

540
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:55,785
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

541
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:57,996
<font color=#00FF40>If you could give
us a lift to Earth,</font>

542
00:59:57,996 --> 01:00:00,081
<font color=#00FF40>we'd give you both
a crate of ketse</font>

543
01:00:02,459 --> 01:00:06,921
<font color=#00FF40>I understand,
you don't believe in words.
What am I thinking?</font>

544
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:13,011
<font color=#00FF40>That your wife is probably
calling the city morgue?</font>

545
01:00:13,011 --> 01:00:16,890
<font color=#00FF40>No, what am
I thinking now?</font>

546
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,558
<font color=#00FF40>That you'll
give me ketse</font>

547
01:00:19,142 --> 01:00:20,643
<font color=#00FF40>See, it's true</font>

548
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:24,689
<font color=#00FF40>What kind of moron
would think true stuff?</font>

549
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,568
<font color=#00FF40>It's absurd</font>

550
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:33,031
<font color=#00FF40>And because you say
what you don't think</font>

551
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:35,116
<font color=#00FF40>and think what
you don't think</font>

552
01:00:35,116 --> 01:00:37,994
<font color=#00FF40>you sit in cages,</font>

553
01:00:37,994 --> 01:00:42,999
<font color=#00FF40>I can see this
whole bitter cataclysm</font>

554
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:46,336
<font color=#00FF40>- and
Vladimir Nickolaevich, too</font>

555
01:00:46,336 --> 01:00:49,672
<font color=#00FF40>They say that Patsaks have
to sing in cages, do we</font>

556
01:00:49,672 --> 01:00:51,758
<font color=#00FF40>Stop freaking out</font>

557
01:00:51,758 --> 01:00:53,843
<font color=#00FF40>It's ok mate,
we'll sing next to it</font>

558
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:58,014
<font color=#00FF40>Get in, he saw us,
he'll trangluke us!</font>

559
01:00:58,014 --> 01:00:59,140
<font color=#00FF40>We're not animals</font>

560
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,226
<font color=#00FF40>What?</font>

561
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:05,230
<font color=#00FF40>No, you'll get in!</font>

562
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,356
<font color=#00FF40>Let go!</font>

563
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:08,441
<font color=#00FF40>Stop it!</font>

564
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:17,450
<font color=#00FF40>Get in, or he'll
melt us down!</font>

565
01:01:17,992 --> 01:01:21,913
<font color=#00FF40>Let's get in, Fiddler,
since the lady's asking</font>

566
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:23,998
<font color=#00FF40>Get in</font>

567
01:01:29,671 --> 01:01:34,676
<font color=#00FF40>One, two, three...</font>

568
01:01:34,676 --> 01:01:36,344
<font color=#FF8000>Dance!</font>

569
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:37,470
<font color=#00FF40>Dance</font>

570
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:41,891
<font color=#00FF40>You know what?
Go book another band</font>

571
01:01:43,017 --> 01:01:45,228
<font color=#FF8000>What?</font>

572
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,449
<font color=#FF8000>Be right back</font>

573
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:02,996
<font color=#00FF40>We have to run</font>

574
01:02:02,996 --> 01:02:06,332
<font color=#00FF40>Boys, give it a push,
it's uphill</font>

575
01:02:06,332 --> 01:02:08,418
<font color=#00FF40>Now this we can do</font>

576
01:02:16,885 --> 01:02:18,553
<font color=#00FF40>Accelerate!</font>

577
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:21,890
<font color=#00FF40>Bye, dorks!</font>

578
01:02:42,452 --> 01:02:50,251
<font color=#FF8000>I'll tell everybody
what this clown PG
did to the planet!</font>

579
01:02:52,462 --> 01:02:57,467
<font color=#FF8000>Patsaks are trampling
all over Chatlans!</font>

580
01:03:05,225 --> 01:03:08,561
<font color=#00FF40>Everything in place?</font>

581
01:03:09,104 --> 01:03:10,647
<font color=#00FF40>She stole
my aftershave</font>

582
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,109
<font color=#00FF40>Women</font>

583
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,787
<font color=#00FF40>Let me.
What do you have
in there - lead?</font>

584
01:03:25,787 --> 01:03:27,455
<font color=#00FF40>I got it,
uncle Vova</font>

585
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:10,248
<font color=#00FF40>I have no idea
where to look</font>

586
01:04:10,248 --> 01:04:12,333
<font color=#00FF40>Where is Earth?</font>

587
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:33,688
Me and comrade Moshkov,
being Patsaks,

588
01:04:33,688 --> 01:04:38,151
could charge 2 chatls
per gig max

589
01:04:38,151 --> 01:04:43,156
Water, luts and bribes
to etselops - at least a chatl a day

590
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:48,161
And a gravitsapa is
worth half a ketse!
That's 2200 chatls

591
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:54,250
Divide by 365,
minus weekends,
equals 6

592
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,587
I simply couldn't get
back in less than 6 years

593
01:04:57,587 --> 01:05:02,592
Gedevan Alexandrovich,
I only have your word for it

594
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:05,387
Do you have any
proof that you came
back from outer space

595
01:05:05,387 --> 01:05:13,144
and not sold the
violin and spent all
that time in the disco?

596
01:05:13,686 --> 01:05:15,939
This is a
local mineral

597
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:19,275
This is a chatl

598
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,486
This is a tsak

599
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:23,696
A metal nut and
a sample of sand

600
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:27,575
are appended to
the report I gave
to the Dean's secretary

601
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:29,661
so she could
forward it to
the United Nations

602
01:05:29,661 --> 01:05:31,496
Where?

603
01:05:31,496 --> 01:05:33,164
To the United Nations

604
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,712
Look, Gedevan Alexandrovich,
you're an adult

605
01:05:38,712 --> 01:05:42,048
You've studied here
for a half-term and then
disappeared for years

606
01:05:42,048 --> 01:05:45,927
And now you come
back with a stone,

607
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:50,348
a piece of
Georgian ceramics

608
01:05:50,348 --> 01:05:53,143
and a bell,

609
01:05:53,143 --> 01:05:55,228
and you expect
me to believe...

610
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:59,816
And by the way,
if you are so musical,

611
01:05:59,816 --> 01:06:04,028
why weren't you in
our student orchestra?

612
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:08,742
Excuse me, Fiddler,
but this is just koo!

613
01:06:10,493 --> 01:06:12,620
END OF PART ONE
