00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:54,480
<font color=#00FF40>Just a second!</font>

11
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:56,565
<font color=#00FF40>I have a proposition</font>

12
00:03:58,192 --> 00:03:59,026
<font color=#FF8000>What?</font>

13
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:05,658
<font color=#00FF40>What do we
think about you?</font>

14
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,411
<font color=#00FF40>Come on, penetrate
my brain</font>

15
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,918
<font color=#FF8000>Why are you bothering us?
What do you want?</font>

16
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,003
<font color=#FF8000>Have you no shame?</font>

17
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,630
<font color=#00FF40>Have you?</font>

18
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:25,261
<font color=#00FF40>We are poor hungry artists!
What have we ever done to you?</font>

19
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,346
<font color=#00FF40>Why are you stalking us?</font>

20
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,767
<font color=#00FF40>Give me the widget</font>

21
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,822
<font color=#00FF40>Come on</font>

22
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,205
<font color=#00FF40>One, two, three...</font>

23
00:04:54,165 --> 00:05:02,548
<font color=#00FF40>Mother, mother,
what will we do? Koo!</font>

24
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,919
<font color=#00FF40>Shut up,
you're tone deaf</font>

25
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:10,074
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova,
let's go again!</font>

26
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:11,784
<font color=#00FF40>They love it!</font>

27
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:13,869
<font color=#00FF40>They understand it!</font>

28
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,287
<font color=#00FF40>One, two...</font>

29
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:17,373
<font color=#00FF40>Etselop!</font>

30
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:45,150
<font color=#00FF40>Artists, where's
our deathtrap?</font>

31
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,068
<font color=#FF8000>Pepelats?</font>

32
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:48,153
<font color=#00FF40>Yes</font>

33
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:49,697
<font color=#00FF40>Over there</font>

34
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:50,948
<font color=#00FF40>We're out of luts</font>

35
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,033
<font color=#FF8000>All because
of you, bitch!</font>

36
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,328
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler! What are you doing?
Vandal!</font>

37
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,414
<font color=#00FF40>Leave me alone!</font>

38
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:08,674
<font color=#00FF40>Mate, this is a last breath,
a grave, a cemetery</font>

39
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,054
<font color=#00FF40>Mate</font>

40
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,766
<font color=#00FF40>And you say you were 'second league'</font>

41
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:18,726
<font color=#FF8000>He was just bragging</font>

42
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,520
<font color=#00FF40>It's not fair, you win
because of my brains</font>

43
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,192
<font color=#FF8000>If you had brains, you'd be
studying Foreign Politics instead
of messing with our mood here</font>

44
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:31,780
<font color=#00FF40>Let's play again.
You bet the violin,
the case and the tooth-stick</font>

45
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,616
<font color=#FF8000>And this</font>

46
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:34,575
<font color=#00FF40>Ok?</font>

47
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:42,124
<font color=#00FF40>Ok. You bet the widget,
visator and Mr Uef's life source</font>

48
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,876
<font color=#00FF40>Sure</font>

49
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,961
<font color=#00FF40>Let's play</font>

50
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:56,013
<font color=#FF8000>Uncle Vova, you have
to twist the tsapa</font>

51
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:56,972
<font color=#00FF40>Here, you do it!</font>

52
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:59,058
<font color=#FF8000>I can't,
I'm Chatlan</font>

53
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:06,273
<font color=#00FF40>Oh sure, when it
comes to advising,
everyone is a Chatlan!</font>

54
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:07,191
<font color=#00FF40>Checkmate</font>

55
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,276
<font color=#00FF40>Not fair!</font>

56
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,862
<font color=#00FF40>You thought up
bad moves for me!</font>

57
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:13,948
<font color=#00FF40>You have to play
using your brains</font>

58
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:17,451
<font color=#FF8000>How could he?
He's never seen these dolls before</font>

59
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,537
<font color=#00FF40>Not my problem.
Give me my winnings</font>

60
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:21,622
<font color=#FF8000>No way</font>

61
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:28,671
<font color=#00FF40>Uef, have you ever seen
such a little Patsak acting like
such a materialistic kyoo?</font>

62
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,383
<font color=#FF8000>Never. I keep saying,
Fiddler is not needed</font>

63
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,136
<font color=#00FF40>Hey, boss!</font>

64
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,643
<font color=#00FF40>And you say - tsapa!</font>

65
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:54,029
<font color=#00FF40>So nobody
sings in cages?</font>

66
00:08:55,698 --> 00:09:01,287
<font color=#00FF40>Mr Bee, on Earth
we only cage animals</font>

67
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,372
<font color=#00FF40>Are animals Chatlans?</font>

68
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,835
<font color=#00FF40>I don't know. Similar</font>

69
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:09,920
<font color=#FF8000>Is a nightingale a Patsak?</font>

70
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,506
<font color=#00FF40>Why Patsak?</font>

71
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:16,218
<font color=#FF8000>You said it doesn't
sing in a cage</font>

72
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,304
<font color=#00FF40>Patsak then</font>

73
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:24,602
<font color=#00FF40>See, you are as
racist as we on Pluk</font>

74
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:28,355
<font color=#00FF40>Only, the power belongs not
to Chatlans, but to Patsaks</font>

75
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:33,027
<font color=#00FF40>Like you and your
nightingale friend</font>

76
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,780
<font color=#00FF40>Let me</font>

77
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:59,738
<font color=#FF8000>Here, 4 gulps</font>

78
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,824
<font color=#00FF40>Give the water to the children</font>

79
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:09,665
<font color=#FF8000>You owe us 6042 boxes.
Fiddler, write it down</font>

80
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,750
<font color=#00FF40>I have</font>

81
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:26,891
<font color=#00FF40>Do you want any?</font>

82
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,644
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

83
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,356
<font color=#00FF40>It's free</font>

84
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,583
<font color=#FF8000>What are you doing?
What about me?</font>

85
00:11:56,754 --> 00:12:00,466
<font color=#00FF40>I'll pay 10 more boxes,
have some water</font>

86
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:10,726
<font color=#00FF40>Kin-dza-dza!</font>

87
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:26,575
<font color=#00FF40>A boat!</font>

88
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:30,329
<font color=#FF8000>It's not a boat,
it's a luts station</font>

89
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,872
<font color=#00FF40>Let's fill up!</font>

90
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,706
<font color=#FF8000>Can't</font>

91
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:39,380
<font color=#00FF40>It's a machine, next one
has a woman. We'll sing -
she'll cut us a deal, got it?</font>

92
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,507
<font color=#FF8000>Stop slacking, uncle Vova</font>

93
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:43,592
<font color=#00FF40>Let's go mate</font>

94
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,767
<font color=#00FF40>If this was a sea,
why aren't there any shells?</font>

95
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:55,479
<font color=#FF8000>Do you still have
seas on Earth?</font>

96
00:12:55,521 --> 00:13:02,027
<font color=#00FF40>We have seas, rivers
and decent people, Mr Uef</font>

97
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,739
<font color=#FF8000>You are such
barbarians, I could cry</font>

98
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:38,564
<font color=#00FF40>It's a shame my boss
can't see me, I'd get a raise</font>

99
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:42,109
<font color=#00FF40>Hush Uncle Vova,
a lady is watching us</font>

100
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:11,972
<font color=#FF8000>They took away the woman,
and put in a machine</font>

101
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:19,438
<font color=#00FF40>Buy as much as you can, we'll
fly at least part of the way</font>

102
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:28,739
<font color=#FF8000>We can't. Luts are
10 chatls per charge,
we have only 7</font>

103
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:44,630
<font color=#00FF40>How far is the Centre?</font>

104
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:47,424
<font color=#00FF40>160 kilometers</font>

105
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:49,510
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova!</font>

106
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,595
<font color=#00FF40>Uef has more chatls</font>

107
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:54,890
<font color=#00FF40>In his right boot</font>

108
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:04,191
<font color=#00FF40>Hey, Chatlan!</font>

109
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:06,986
<font color=#FF8000>What?</font>

110
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:09,780
<font color=#00FF40>Take off your right boot</font>

111
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:11,866
<font color=#FF8000>What for?</font>

112
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:13,951
<font color=#00FF40>Come on, koo, koo</font>

113
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,684
<font color=#FF8000>Kyoo, bitch!</font>

114
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,109
<font color=#00FF40>Squat!</font>

115
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,821
<font color=#00FF40>Why? They are not etselops</font>

116
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:57,286
<font color=#00FF40>It's PG and his Patsak
You can get etsih with nails
for life by not squatting!</font>

117
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:58,496
<font color=#00FF40>But who is he?</font>

118
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,342
<font color=#00FF40>Did you see that?</font>

119
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:14,136
<font color=#00FF40>Yeah. It's a hologram, mate!</font>

120
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:15,095
<font color=#00FF40>The Violin!</font>

121
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:23,479
<font color=#00FF40>Calm down! Freeze!</font>

122
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,862
<font color=#00FF40>And you said - koo!</font>

123
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:54,385
<font color=#FF8000>It's not a blimp moron,
it's the last breath of Mr PG</font>

124
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:55,302
<font color=#00FF40>Rubbish</font>

125
00:16:57,221 --> 00:17:01,934
<font color=#00FF40>How could one man breathe
so much air while dying?
It's absurd</font>

126
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,688
<font color=#00FF40>What are you saying!
PG is alive!
And I'm happy!</font>

127
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:08,524
<font color=#FF8000>I'm even happier</font>

128
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,819
<font color=#00FF40>Climb inside</font>

129
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,737
<font color=#00FF40>Plastic?</font>

130
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,030
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

131
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,492
<font color=#00FF40>Is there a normal way
into this supermarket?</font>

132
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:03,245
<font color=#00FF40>To get in normally, we have
to pay in chatls mate</font>

133
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,064
<font color=#00FF40>Let's go</font>

134
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:13,065
<font color=#FF8000>Get lost!</font>

135
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,524
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler, Patsaks go there</font>

136
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,213
<font color=#00FF40>What are they doing?</font>

137
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:21,926
<font color=#00FF40>It's Mr PG's fourth pump</font>

138
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:24,011
<font color=#00FF40>I love PG very much!</font>

139
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,096
<font color=#FF8000>I koo him even more!</font>

140
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:53,999
<font color=#00FF40>Here they make
water out of luts</font>

141
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:25,114
<font color=#00FF40>What are they saying?</font>

142
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:27,324
<font color=#00FF40>They are selling</font>

143
00:21:28,993 --> 00:21:30,911
<font color=#00FF40>What are they selling?</font>

144
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,997
<font color=#FF8000>Everything</font>

145
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:34,665
<font color=#00FF40>Let's buy a gravitsapa!</font>

146
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:36,750
<font color=#00FF40>It's in another department</font>

147
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,255
<font color=#00FF40>We first need to find out
Earth's tentura number</font>

148
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,723
<font color=#FF8000>Yellow pants - koo twice!</font>

149
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:23,339
<font color=#00FF40>Think of the orbit diameter
of your planet</font>

150
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:25,716
<font color=#00FF40>I don't remember</font>

151
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:27,801
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler, you do it</font>

152
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,887
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler isn't needed,
you do it!</font>

153
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:33,265
<font color=#00FF40>Oh, all right</font>

154
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,855
<font color=#00FF40>Think of your planets
core density</font>

155
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:42,691
<font color=#00FF40>Density?
I can't remember</font>

156
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,777
<font color=#00FF40>I see</font>

157
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:51,200
<font color=#00FF40>Think of the planets in your Galaxy,
as many as you know</font>

158
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:55,913
<font color=#00FF40>Jupiter, Mars, Venus...</font>

159
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:59,667
<font color=#00FF40>Where is my divination crystal?
It was right there!</font>

160
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,086
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler, put it back!</font>

161
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:07,216
<font color=#00FF40>I thought it was just a
piece of glass, rubbish</font>

162
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,011
<font color=#FF8000>Stupid cow</font>

163
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:13,848
<font color=#00FF40>Enough</font>

164
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:16,684
<font color=#00FF40>Stop rattling your brains moron</font>

165
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:19,478
<font color=#00FF40>Here is your planet</font>

166
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,274
<font color=#00FF40>Here is your planet: 013 in tentura,
just left of Ursa Major</font>

167
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:27,027
<font color=#00FF40>If you want to talk,
that's extra</font>

168
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:27,987
<font color=#00FF40>Pardon?</font>

169
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:30,072
<font color=#FF8000>Think of your phone number</font>

170
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,536
<font color=#FF8000>And tell them about the matches</font>

171
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:51,760
<font color=#00FF40>Hello, I'm listening</font>

172
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:53,179
<font color=#00FF40>Speak there</font>

173
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:58,184
<font color=#00FF40>Hello, I'm listening!</font>

174
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,897
<font color=#00FF40>Speak, time is money</font>

175
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:04,982
<font color=#00FF40>Hello, Lucy</font>

176
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:05,733
<font color=#00FF40>Vovka?</font>

177
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,818
<font color=#00FF40>Can you hear me ok? It's me!</font>

178
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:09,904
<font color=#00FF40>Vovka, where are you?</font>

179
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:14,200
<font color=#00FF40>I'm here. How are you?</font>

180
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,367
<font color=#00FF40>How's our son?</font>

181
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:17,995
<font color=#00FF40>Where are you, Vovka?</font>

182
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:21,749
<font color=#00FF40>I'm here, in this place,
I'll explain later</font>

183
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:26,462
<font color=#00FF40>How's mum?
Have you seen her?</font>

184
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:31,175
<font color=#00FF40>Yes I have. I'm asking you,
where are you?</font>

185
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:39,683
<font color=#FF8000>Hey, she-Patsak, quit messing with us,
go buy two crates of ketse!
Or we'll find him another...</font>

186
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:46,273
<font color=#00FF40>Lucy!</font>

187
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:48,359
<font color=#00FF40>My dear!</font>

188
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,444
<font color=#00FF40>Lucy!</font>

189
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:59,495
<font color=#00FF40>Call Manokhin, tell him
that the keys to the
building store are in my office,</font>

190
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:03,249
<font color=#00FF40>under the cabinet,
do you understand?</font>

191
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:07,127
<font color=#00FF40>Oh, I understand</font>

192
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:14,593
<font color=#00FF40>Please dial Batumi 3-47-57
and ask for Alik</font>

193
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:18,347
<font color=#00FF40>No.
Get lost thief</font>

194
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,835
<font color=#00FF40>Is something wrong?</font>

195
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,176
<font color=#00FF40>Everything's fine,
but Earth is very far away</font>

196
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,970
<font color=#00FF40>It will take 7 minutes instead of 5</font>

197
00:25:58,012 --> 00:26:01,765
<font color=#00FF40>Let's go and prepare some
tsapa for the gravitsapa</font>

198
00:26:02,683 --> 00:26:06,478
<font color=#00FF40>Astronauts!
Which one is tsapa?</font>

199
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,564
<font color=#00FF40>It's a rusty metal nut mate</font>

200
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:13,068
<font color=#00FF40>Everything is rusty here</font>

201
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,864
<font color=#00FF40>That one is the rustiest</font>

202
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:25,331
<font color=#00FF40>What are you doing,
are you nuts?</font>

203
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:33,839
<font color=#FF8000>Wow, Lucy and Manokhin
have been transported!</font>

204
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:46,101
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova!
The match was in the hat!</font>

205
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:48,938
<font color=#00FF40>Weird. Why would they leave?</font>

206
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:53,651
<font color=#00FF40>Weird? They have a match
to buy a gravitsapa, and
they know where Earth is!</font>

207
00:26:56,487 --> 00:27:02,117
<font color=#00FF40>Comrade etselop!</font>

208
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,203
<font color=#00FF40>They stole from us!</font>

209
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:06,288
<font color=#00FF40>Please catch them!</font>

210
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:14,296
<font color=#FF8000>40 chatls</font>

211
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:19,134
<font color=#00FF40>Our money is with the guide.
That's not even my violin!</font>

212
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:25,724
<font color=#00FF40>They did not koo in
front of a video of PG.
What are you staring at?</font>

213
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:33,274
<font color=#00FF40>I'll tell that you knew and did nothing,
you'll be fucking trangluked! Right?</font>

214
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:37,987
<font color=#FF8000>I didn't do nothing.
I pressed the kappa at once</font>

215
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:40,072
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler is a witness</font>

216
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,536
<font color=#FF8000>Calling all patrols!</font>

217
00:27:48,372 --> 00:27:51,000
<font color=#00FF40>There's nothing there</font>

218
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,085
<font color=#FF8000>Open it</font>

219
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:55,171
<font color=#00FF40>Let them see</font>

220
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:10,060
<font color=#00FF40>It's vinegar</font>

221
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,897
<font color=#FF8000>That's none of your business</font>

222
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,749
<font color=#FF8000>The Patsak will be trangluked,
the Chatlan gets etsih
for life - with nails</font>

223
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:45,930
<font color=#00FF40>Brother Patsak tell them
the truth, that I squatted,
it was this Chatlan...</font>

224
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:53,479
<font color=#FF8000>Shut up parasite!</font>

225
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,356
<font color=#00FF40>You shut up!</font>

226
00:28:56,273 --> 00:29:00,986
<font color=#FF8000>Vovka, my friend!
Gedevan Alexandrovich!</font>

227
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:03,072
<font color=#FF8000>Tell them it was him!</font>

228
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:05,157
<font color=#FF8000>He was the one
who did not squat</font>

229
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,659
<font color=#FF8000>And I will give
you the Pepelats</font>

230
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,744
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova,
the Pepelats is mine!</font>

231
00:29:10,454 --> 00:29:14,208
<font color=#00FF40>Calm down</font>

232
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:23,634
<font color=#00FF40>Everything's fine.
Everybody squatted like monkeys.
I was wrong</font>

233
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:27,429
<font color=#00FF40>And it was me who
brought the ketse here</font>

234
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,142
<font color=#FF8000>What ketse?</font>

235
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:35,896
<font color=#00FF40>That match you
took out of the hat</font>

236
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,982
<font color=#FF8000>There was no match</font>

237
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:40,609
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova, mate,
what are you saying!</font>

238
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,695
<font color=#00FF40>Sorry, I forgot</font>

239
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:44,780
<font color=#00FF40>There was no match</font>

240
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:46,866
<font color=#00FF40>There was no match</font>

241
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:58,544
<font color=#FF8000>You two, etsih without nails - for life.
Until the fee of 500 chatls is paid</font>

242
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:00,629
<font color=#FF8000>Thank you!</font>

243
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,216
<font color=#FF8000>Patsak, fix the violin and sing</font>

244
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:07,970
<font color=#FF8000>Fiddler, work that widget!</font>

245
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:11,765
<font color=#00FF40>Guys, we were just kidding,
we thought it would be a laugh!</font>

246
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,602
<font color=#FF8000>See you!</font>

247
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:35,331
<font color=#00FF40>Hello, Earthling!</font>

248
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:40,044
<font color=#00FF40>I knew one day your explorations
would carry you to this planet</font>

249
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,675
<font color=#00FF40>Greetings from
Vladimir Nickolaevich Moshkov,</font>

250
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:48,761
<font color=#00FF40>construction foreman from Moskow</font>

251
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,846
<font color=#00FF40>and Gedevan Alexidze
from Batumi</font>

252
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:57,061
<font color=#00FF40>We were the first to set foot
onto this wretched sand in the
backwater of the Universe</font>

253
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:01,774
<font color=#00FF40>Brother Patsak
add some fuel</font>

254
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,859
<font color=#00FF40>Give me something else then</font>

255
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:23,462
<font color=#00FF40>Maybe by this time,
some people who knew
me are still alive</font>

256
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:27,216
<font color=#00FF40>Please tell them that
I did not steal the violin...</font>

257
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:29,301
<font color=#00FF40>Look, good as new</font>

258
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:38,561
<font color=#00FF40>Here is another piece</font>

259
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:42,314
<font color=#00FF40>Yeah, this sort of
thing can happen</font>

260
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,495
<font color=#00FF40>Is it nutritious?</font>

261
00:31:56,495 --> 00:32:01,208
<font color=#00FF40>Earthlings!
You really shouldn't have
pressed it like that</font>

262
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:04,962
<font color=#00FF40>I only found you
thanks to the dial memory</font>

263
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:07,798
<font color=#00FF40>I'm returning your sock,
thank you</font>

264
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:11,594
<font color=#00FF40>If you wish,
I can transport
you back to Earth,</font>

265
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:13,679
<font color=#00FF40>I found out your tentura number</font>

266
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,559
<font color=#00FF40>But you have to hurry,
one second here
is half a year there</font>

267
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:20,436
<font color=#00FF40>I have a proposition</font>

268
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:24,565
<font color=#00FF40>We go to Earth,
get some matches,
go back, sell them...</font>

00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,486
<font color=#00FF40>go to Moscow
and you go home</font>

271
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:30,279
<font color=#00FF40>I can't do that,
I only have 3 charges</font>

272
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:31,447
<font color=#00FF40>That's great!</font>

273
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:35,493
<font color=#00FF40>Enough to go there,
here and back again</font>

274
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:37,953
<font color=#00FF40>And what about me?</font>

275
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:40,456
<font color=#00FF40>Listen, freind</font>

<font color=#00FF40>I'm counting to three.
One...</font>

278

<font color=#00FF40>Please understand,
they are in jail
because of me</font>

281
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:02,520
<font color=#00FF40>And my little son has
a beard like this by now!</font>

282
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:04,605
<font color=#00FF40>Two and a half...</font>

283
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:06,398
<font color=#00FF40>Two and a half!</font>

284
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,484
<font color=#00FF40>I cannot do this</font>

285
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:11,403
<font color=#00FF40>Three</font>

286
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:31,841
<font color=#00FF40>Who needs all this stuff?</font>

287
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,135
<font color=#00FF40>Stupid tsaks,
all this rubbish...</font>

288
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,679
<font color=#00FF40>We'll never...</font>

289
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,651
<font color=#00FF40>Where did you
get this from? Huh?</font>

290
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,115
<font color=#00FF40>It was just lying around
in the planetarium,
on the shelf</font>

291
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,783
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler...</font>

295
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:58,093
<font color=#FF8000>Why are you
singing standing up?</font>

296
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,179
<font color=#FF8000>It's only allowed over there</font>

297
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,933
<font color=#00FF40>The Etselop didn't
let us sing there</font>

298
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:07,478
<font color=#FF8000>Here you can only
sing on your knees</font>

299
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:09,355
<font color=#00FF40>We're fine as we are</font>

300
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:12,274
<font color=#00FF40>Come on,

307
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:18,757
<font color=#FF8000>What's new on Pluk?</font>

00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:49,348
<font color=#00FF40>I can't stand
this any longer</font>

313
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:51,433
<font color=#00FF40>Calm down, Fiddler</font>

314
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:55,980

315
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,859
<font color=#00FF40>I think we've
made enough</font>

<font color=#00FF40>Why aren't you
wearing muzzles?</font>

320
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:28,262
<font color=#FF8000>Turn around</font>

<font color=#00FF40>Starting her up...</font>

00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:54,542
<font color=#00FF40>Come on, gentlemen,
before they come
to their senses!</font>

399
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,752
<font color=#FF8000>You're not helping!</font>

400
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:21,026
<font color=#00FF40>And we've landed</font>

401
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,028
<font color=#00FF40>Landed where?</font>

402
00:46:25,823 --> 00:46:27,283
<font color=#FF8000>Hanut</font>

403
00:46:29,034 --> 00:46:30,661
<font color=#00FF40>What's Hanut?</font>

404
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,247
<font color=#FF8000>The planet where
I was born</font>

405
00:46:33,664 --> 00:46:35,249
<font color=#00FF40>And me</font>

406
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,794
<font color=#00FF40>It's night</font>

407
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:41,130
<font color=#FF8000>Now it's always night here</font>

408
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:42,381
<font color=#00FF40>Put this on</font>

409
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:43,507
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

410
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:45,801
<font color=#00FF40>There's no bloody air here</font>

411
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:48,179
<font color=#00FF40>So how do you live here?</font>

412
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:51,682
<font color=#FF8000>Nobody has lived here for ages</font>

413
00:46:52,057 --> 00:46:55,060
<font color=#FF8000>Plukans trangluked the planet...</font>

414
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:56,896
<font color=#00FF40>while we were on tour</font>

415
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:58,230
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

416
00:46:58,564 --> 00:47:00,483
<font color=#00FF40>Because we did
not get them first</font>

417
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,610
<font color=#00FF40>Why did you want
to get them?</font>

418
00:47:02,735 --> 00:47:05,321
<font color=#FF8000>So they'd stop bugging
us with their existense</font>

419
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,323
<font color=#00FF40>Did everybody die?</font>

420
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:09,408
<font color=#FF8000>Of course</font>

421
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:13,078
<font color=#00FF40>Vovka, I have a proposition</font>

422
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:15,414
<font color=#00FF40>This planet now costs peanuts</font>

423
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:16,790
<font color=#FF8000>63 chatls</font>

424
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:19,919
<font color=#00FF40>We'll tour the galaxy for a
month singing 'Mother, Mother'...</font>

425
00:47:20,044 --> 00:47:21,504
<font color=#00FF40>and the planet is ours!</font>

426
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:23,756
<font color=#00FF40>Another month and we'll
even be able to buy air</font>

427
00:47:24,298 --> 00:47:25,841
<font color=#FF8000>93 chatls</font>

428
00:47:26,258 --> 00:47:27,927
<font color=#00FF40>Everyone who has no air</font>

429
00:47:28,344 --> 00:47:30,012
<font color=#00FF40>will rush straight here</font>

430
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:31,555
<font color=#00FF40>The air belongs to us</font>

431
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,517
<font color=#FF8000>They will crawl before us,
and we will spit on them</font>

432
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:36,143
<font color=#00FF40>What for?</font>

433
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,895
<font color=#FF8000>For fun</font>

434
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:39,980
<font color=#00FF40>What kind of fun is that?</font>

435
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:42,817
<font color=#00FF40>He's so young</font>

436
00:47:43,234 --> 00:47:46,737
<font color=#FF8000>Half of the planet could be
yours, the other half ours. OK?</font>

437
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:51,784
<font color=#00FF40>This is very tempting</font>

438
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:54,912
<font color=#00FF40>But we need to
go back to Earth</font>

439
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:59,500
<font color=#00FF40>Let's move, the supermarket
shuts in half an hour</font>

440
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:05,589
<font color=#FF8000>Vovka, relax</font>

441
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:10,803
<font color=#00FF40>Look</font>

442
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:16,225
<font color=#00FF40>We're here</font>

443
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:18,352
<font color=#00FF40>Earth is there</font>

444
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:20,187
<font color=#FF8000>And there is Alpha</font>

445
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:23,566
<font color=#00FF40>On Alpha they turn
us into cactuses</font>

446
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:26,652
<font color=#00FF40>Earth is in
anti-tentura, dear</font>

447
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:30,656
<font color=#00FF40>We cannot get
there, understand?</font>

448
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:32,741
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

449
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:36,287
<font color=#00FF40>That's how it is.
It's just my luck really</font>

450
00:48:37,496 --> 00:48:40,207
<font color=#FF8000>A Pepelats can't
get to Earth!</font>

451
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,668
<font color=#FF8000>So quit arguing</font>

452
00:48:42,877 --> 00:48:44,170
<font color=#FF8000>Ok?</font>

453
00:48:44,712 --> 00:48:47,298
<font color=#FF8000>Let's go and decide how
we will share the planet</font>

454
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:00,603
<font color=#00FF40>Did you learn about
this in the planetarium?</font>

455
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,730
<font color=#00FF40>Yes mate</font>

456
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:06,233
<font color=#00FF40>That's why you
stole the match?</font>

457
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,152
<font color=#FF8000>Of course</font>

458
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:10,905
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Vova,
they're lying!</font>

459
00:49:12,323 --> 00:49:14,617
<font color=#00FF40>Don't believe them</font>

460
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:18,871
<font color=#00FF40>Get us to Earth, now!</font>

461
00:49:19,997 --> 00:49:21,749
<font color=#00FF40>No, Gedevan</font>

462
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:23,792
<font color=#00FF40>They're not lying</font>

463
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:30,257
<font color=#00FF40>They'd crawl across the Universe
on their stomachs for a
chance to get some matches</font>

464
00:49:47,983 --> 00:49:50,778
<font color=#00FF40>Vovka, it's a
silly thing to do</font>

465
00:49:51,445 --> 00:49:54,490
<font color=#00FF40>This air has
only 2% oxygen</font>

466
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:02,057
<font color=#00FF40>Gedevan</font>

467
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,604
<font color=#00FF40>Don't do this,
you're so young.
Live!</font>

468
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:09,273
<font color=#00FF40>Maybe things will change</font>

469
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:15,154
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler isn't needed, Uncle Vova</font>

470
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:33,422
<font color=#FF8000>Patsak!</font>

471
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:41,931
<font color=#FF8000>You're going to
die in a moment</font>

472
00:51:43,808 --> 00:51:46,060
<font color=#FF8000>so tell us the
truth for once</font>

473
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:51,649
<font color=#FF8000>Why didn't you teleport
home with that jerk
while you could?</font>

474
00:51:52,441 --> 00:51:54,401
<font color=#FF8000>What did you want?</font>

475
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,321
<font color=#FF8000>Purple pants?</font>

476
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,406
<font color=#FF8000>PG's bathtub?</font>

477
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:01,992
<font color=#FF8000>Tell us,
what did you want?</font>

478
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:10,918
<font color=#FF8000>Gedevan,
dear friend</font>

479
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,879
<font color=#FF8000>You tell me</font>

480
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,674
<font color=#FF8000>You can tell me,
I'm one of us</font>

481
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:19,718
<font color=#FF8000>My mother was Georgian</font>

482
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,985
<font color=#00FF40>He says his mother
was a local Georgian</font>

483
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:37,570
<font color=#00FF40>Uef!</font>

484
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:39,363
<font color=#00FF40>I don't care</font>

485
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:43,325
<font color=#00FF40>I will koo them to Alpha!</font>

486
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:46,328
<font color=#00FF40>And you,
lousy Chatlan</font>

487
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:47,454
<font color=#00FF40>put on the tsak</font>

488
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:50,207
<font color=#00FF40>and squat when you
talk to a Patsak!</font>

489
00:52:50,332 --> 00:52:53,127
<font color=#00FF40>Hanut is a Patsak
planet mate</font>

490
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:58,424
<font color=#00FF40>Say it again</font>

491
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:01,886
<font color=#00FF40>You will
catapult us to Alpha</font>

492
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:05,347
<font color=#00FF40>and try to stop
the ship in its orbit</font>

493
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,641
<font color=#FF8000>There's no way we
can break over there!</font>

494
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,310
<font color=#00FF40>Don't interrupt</font>

495
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,439
<font color=#00FF40>Carry on mate</font>

496
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:17,943
<font color=#00FF40>On Alpha, while they
transport us to Earth</font>

497
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:21,780
<font color=#00FF40>we will hold on to the bottom of
the space-transportation gadget</font>

498
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:24,366
<font color=#00FF40>and the gadget will
transport with us</font>

499
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:25,659
<font color=#00FF40>On Earth,...</font>

500
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:29,830
<font color=#00FF40>we will buy you
4 crates of matches</font>

501
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:32,917
<font color=#00FF40>Carry on mate</font>

502
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:36,295
<font color=#00FF40>How many times do
we have to go over it?</font>

503
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:37,546
<font color=#00FF40>Let's go</font>

504
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,842
<font color=#FF8000>Because of you I will spend
an eternity in a plant pot</font>

505
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:47,807
<font color=#FF8000>and you can't
even do this for us</font>

506
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:55,356
<font color=#00FF40>My dear, good friends</font>

507
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:58,484
<font color=#00FF40>Lets' fly already or
at least close this door</font>

508
00:53:59,777 --> 00:54:02,154
<font color=#FF8000>I can't stand the sight
of you any longer</font>

509
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:05,282
<font color=#00FF40>I'm going to be sick
any moment now</font>

510
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,748
<font color=#00FF40>So long mate</font>

511
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:20,923
<font color=#00FF40>And we're flying</font>

512
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,508
<font color=#FF8000>Break!</font>

513
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:25,052
<font color=#FF8000>Break!</font>

514
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:27,638
<font color=#FF8000>Break!</font>

515
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:32,434
<font color=#00FF40>How can I?
You've drunk all our
breaking fluid! Alcoholic</font>

516
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,563
<font color=#00FF40>Can't be good for him</font>

517
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:37,773
<font color=#00FF40>Turn off your antlers</font>

518
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:39,066
<font color=#00FF40>They can't be turned off</font>

519
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:40,526
<font color=#00FF40>Take them off then</font>

520
00:54:40,693 --> 00:54:42,069
<font color=#00FF40>They might break</font>

521
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,240
<font color=#00FF40>I think we've landed</font>

522
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:48,242
<font color=#00FF40>That's how it
was the last time</font>

523
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:49,827
<font color=#00FF40>All right</font>

524
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:52,246
<font color=#00FF40>Put on your
gas mask</font>

525
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:53,414
<font color=#00FF40>What about tsak?</font>

526
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:55,374
<font color=#00FF40>No, they'll have
to do without</font>

527
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:03,048
<font color=#00FF40>Earth!</font>

528
00:55:27,948 --> 00:55:33,245
<font color=#FF8000>''Om the river, om the far river bamk... ''</font>

529
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:40,002
<font color=#00FF40>No</font>

530
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:42,963
<font color=#00FF40>This isn't Earth</font>

531
00:55:48,093 --> 00:55:49,762
<font color=#00FF40>Hello</font>

532
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,516
<font color=#00FF40>We're Patsaks
from planet Earth</font>

533
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:54,892
<font color=#00FF40>Who are you?</font>

534
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,394
This is planet Alpha

535
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,897
Tell Decont here,
your coordinates

536
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:03,317
and she will transport
you to the starting point

537
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:05,903
Have a nice day

538
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:09,990
Please give me
your planet number

539
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,452
<font color=#00FF40>013 in tentura</font>

540
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,583
<font color=#00FF40>It's somewhere here</font>

541
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:23,003
<font color=#00FF40>To the left of Ursa Major</font>

542
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:24,505
This is not necessary

543
00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:27,174
Would you please
hold your hands

544
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:29,844
<font color=#00FF40>Miss, what did
you do with them?</font>

545
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,513
They are in the
Second Greenhouse

546
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:35,307
Would you please
hold your hands

547
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,852
<font color=#00FF40>Do you really turn
people into cactuses?</font>

548
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:39,061
Only people from Pluk

549
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:41,564
<font color=#00FF40>They're not Plukans,
they're Hanutians</font>

550
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,815
This is not relevant

551
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,985
Would you please
put the mask on

552
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:47,862
<font color=#00FF40>Why?</font>

553
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:49,280
<font color=#00FF40>You have beautiful air</font>

554
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,906
That's why

555
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,825
<font color=#00FF40>Would you get a load of her!</font>

556
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:54,285
<font color=#00FF40>Calm down.
Put it on</font>

557
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,327
<font color=#00FF40>Gedevan!</font>

558
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:01,208
<font color=#00FF40>On behalf of the
people of Earth, please...</font>

559
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,462
<font color=#00FF40>Let them go</font>

560
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:13,179
<font color=#00FF40>Who can make
this decision?</font>

561
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:15,139
Abradox can

562
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:16,307
But...

563
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:19,810
<font color=#00FF40>Take us to him</font>

564
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:20,936
<font color=#00FF40>Take us to him!</font>

565
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:25,941
<font color=#00FF40>Or I'll take off the
mask and breathe
on everything!</font>

566
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:29,278
You shouldn't worry

567
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:32,114
Our greenhouses provide
the best environment

568
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,159
Blossoming, microclimate,
peace and quiet

569
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:38,370
You should envy them

570
00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:42,750
<font color=#00FF40>Then my dear, why do
you frolic around...</font>

571
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:44,752
<font color=#00FF40>instead of sitting
in a plant pot?</font>

572
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,420
Please watch your step

573
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:48,839
you have already
broken 3 blades of grass

574
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:50,424
<font color=#00FF40>Friend!</font>

575
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:53,344
<font color=#00FF40>We want to ask
you something</font>

576
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,930
No need to continue

577
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:57,431
No

578
00:57:58,098 --> 00:58:00,726
Our proximity to the
Kin-dza-dza Galaxy...

579
00:58:01,602 --> 00:58:02,853
is our greatest problem

580
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:05,648
They are plagued by
yearnings and desires

581
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,192
vile desires!

582
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:11,862
Being transformed
into plants

583
00:58:12,613 --> 00:58:14,406
is much better for them...

584
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,158
and for everyone else!

585
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:19,328
<font color=#00FF40>Maybe we should bring
them here and ask them</font>

586
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:22,164
<font color=#00FF40>Let them decide what's better</font>

587
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:28,671
If we give that sort
the opportunity to decide
about anything...

588
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:33,676
<font color=#00FF40>Girly, are you the
smartest people around?</font>

589
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:38,389
<font color=#00FF40>Did somebody tell you
or did you decided
it all on your own?</font>

590
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,057
Let's not waste time

591
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,769
You are creatures
from anti-tentura

592
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,481
That means I have an
obligation to transport you...

593
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:50,860
to the starting
point of your journey

594
00:58:51,652 --> 00:58:53,988
Or, we can send
you back in time...

595
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:58,200
to the moment when you can
choose your fate for yourselves

596
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,451
Make a decision

597
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:01,203
<font color=#00FF40>I don't understand</font>

598
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:02,788
<font color=#00FF40>Back in time?</font>

599
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,582
I can send you
to the past

600
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,792
Back to Pluk

601
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,391
<font color=#00FF40>Can you send
one of us to Earth</font>

602
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:25,269
<font color=#00FF40>and the other
one back in time?</font>

603
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,147
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich</font>

604
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,650
<font color=#00FF40>No way will I let you
return to Pluk alone</font>

605
00:59:37,114 --> 00:59:38,491
<font color=#00FF40>Listen you</font>

606
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,701
<font color=#00FF40>send us back in time!</font>

607
00:59:52,379 --> 00:59:55,674
<font color=#00FF40>How long was I fixing the
violin? About 50 minutes?</font>

608
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:58,010
<font color=#00FF40>About 50</font>

609
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:03,849
<font color=#00FF40>Brother Patsak</font>

610
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:05,851
<font color=#00FF40>a guy with a sock
will be here soon</font>

611
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,520
<font color=#00FF40>Tell him to meet
us at the etsih</font>

612
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,938
<font color=#00FF40>Do you know the etsih?</font>

613
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:09,522
<font color=#00FF40>Sure</font>

614
01:00:10,564 --> 01:00:11,607
<font color=#00FF40>Will you show us?</font>

615
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:13,651
<font color=#00FF40>Give me something else then</font>

616
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:16,570
<font color=#00FF40>Everybody, rest
for half an hour!</font>

617
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:22,493
<font color=#00FF40>Thank you friends</font>

618
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,886
<font color=#00FF40>Carry on playing, boys</font>

619
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,068
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler, hurry up!</font>

620
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,865
<font color=#00FF40>Not again! You bitches!</font>

621
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,533
<font color=#00FF40>Yep.
Now get out of there</font>

622
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:03,534
<font color=#FF8000>Like hell!</font>

623
01:01:04,785 --> 01:01:06,829
<font color=#FF8000>It's better here
than on Alpha</font>

624
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,539
<font color=#00FF40>Get them out</font>

625
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,425
<font color=#00FF40>We'll have a space-transport
gizmo in a minute</font>

626
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,051
<font color=#00FF40>Vladimir Nickolaevich!</font>

627
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,637
<font color=#00FF40>You owe us 11,000 boxes</font>

628
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,347
<font color=#00FF40>Fiddler has it
written down</font>

629
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:27,099
<font color=#FF8000>11,020</font>

630
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:29,101
<font color=#FF8000>I have a proposition</font>

631
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,102
<font color=#FF8000>Vovka</font>

632
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,729
<font color=#FF8000>We will transport together</font>

633
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,481
<font color=#FF8000>right into the
supermarket</font>

634
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,274
<font color=#FF8000>and after we
buy everything...</font>

635
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,442
<font color=#00FF40>There is no 'after'</font>

636
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,570
<font color=#00FF40>We're only going to Earth</font>

637
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:42,406
<font color=#FF8000>Forever?</font>

638
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:44,867
<font color=#00FF40>Forever</font>

639
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,414
<font color=#FF8000>Me, on a planet where
they don't know who has to
squat in front of whom?</font>

640
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:51,624
<font color=#FF8000>Nonsense</font>

641
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,834
<font color=#FF8000>Give us the gravitsapa
and you do what you want</font>

642
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,503
<font color=#00FF40>Uncle Uef, uncle Bee,</font>

643
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:57,171
<font color=#00FF40>You will be very welcome there!</font>

644
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,464
<font color=#00FF40>No, my friend</font>

645
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,384
<font color=#00FF40>A society without the colour
differentiation of pants...</font>

646
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,261
<font color=#00FF40>is a society without purpose</font>

647
01:02:04,386 --> 01:02:05,805
<font color=#00FF40>And without a purpose...</font>

648
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,891
<font color=#00FF40>Enough with the philosophy,
he's going to appear soon</font>

649
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,976
<font color=#00FF40>Make up your mind</font>

650
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:12,603
<font color=#00FF40>Are you going with us?</font>

651
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,231
<font color=#FF8000>Just give us
the gravitsapa!</font>

652
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,777
<font color=#00FF40>Give it to them</font>

653
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:24,031
<font color=#00FF40>Pity</font>

654
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,168
<font color=#00FF40>So</font>

655
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:40,297
<font color=#00FF40>We should say our farewells</font>

656
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,053
<font color=#00FF40>I kind of got used to you</font>

657
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,765
<font color=#00FF40>Me too</font>

658
01:03:09,034 --> 01:03:10,161
<font color=#00FF40>Well</font>

659
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,121
<font color=#00FF40>Take care</font>

660
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,081
<font color=#00FF40>Friends!</font>

661
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:15,708
<font color=#00FF40>Patsaks!</font>

662
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,295
<font color=#00FF40>Here is your sock
back, thank you</font>

663
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:22,089
<font color=#00FF40>If you wish...</font>

664
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:22,715
<font color=#FF8000>Friend!</font>

665
01:03:23,215 --> 01:03:25,843
<font color=#FF8000>What system is your gadget?</font>

666
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,430
<font color=#FF8000>Might I take a look?</font>

667
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,724
<font color=#00FF40>Regular system</font>

668
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,518
<font color=#00FF40>You press a button
- and you're home</font>

669
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:51,827
Hi

670
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,579
Hi

671
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:54,872
How was your day?

672
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:59,919
Some pipes burst at
Manokhin's building site

673
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:29,198
''Mother, mother, what will we do,
Mother, mother, how will we live?''

674
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:37,540
How's our A-student?

675
01:04:38,415 --> 01:04:39,625
He's out with friends

676
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,294
Vovka! I forgot to buy
bread, will you go?

677
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:46,841
And buy some noodles!

678
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,694
Comrade

679
01:05:07,444 --> 01:05:08,779
How could I get to
the Old Arbat street?

680
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:10,865
Turn right over there

681
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,616
Thank you

682
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:37,892
Fiddler?

683
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,607
Uncle Vova?

684
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,615
Fiddler!

685
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:56,535
Uncle Vova!

686
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:35,950
The End
